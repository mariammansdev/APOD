# Project Name

This project is **APOD**, which provides APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) features powered by NASA's API. The APOD API offers a new image or video every day, along with a brief explanation of what is being shown.

## Pages

### 1. Home Page
The home page is where you land first when you visit the project. It includes:
- A **brief description** of the project.
- A **search area** that allows you to retrieve APOD media for a certain date. By default, it displays the APOD for today's date, but you can search for media from past dates.

### 2. APOD Media View
The second page is inspired by a YouTube tutorial on how to beautify the view of APOD media. It offers a clean and visually appealing layout to display the media, enhancing the user experience when viewing the APOD content.
